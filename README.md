- 👋 Hi, I’m Geerthika Senthil
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and data engineering. I have practical experience in both fields at companies like the Ministry of Attorney General and PepsiCo, where I worked in data science roles. 
  My preferred stack are:
   - Ruby on Rails for Backend Development
   - JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Frontend Development
   - Python for Data Processing & Analysis
   - Java for Object Oriented Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently delving into machine learning concepts like natural language processing.
